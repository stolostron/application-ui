welcome.paragraph.mcm.title = Multicluster operations and visibility
welcome.paragraph.mcm.description = IBM Multicloud Manager provides a way to perform parallel queries against multiple clusters and aggregate that information by various criteria. This information is augmented by near real-time pod traffic views, using WeaveScope, which enables an understanding of how pods inter-communicate. Using the IBM Multicloud Manager, you can have rich views of how clusters operate within the environment. You can see dashboards of aggregated information across multiple clusters, view the topology of resources within those clusters, or navigate into individual clusters consoles for more detailed views.
welcome.paragraph.example.title = The following are examples of IBM Multicloud Manager usage:
welcome.paragraph.example.description = View the health of all the clusters in a given region. Know how many nodes are down in all the clusters. View the pods in a given namespace in all development clusters. See all the failed pods in a specific data center.

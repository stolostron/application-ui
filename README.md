# application-ui[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/open-cluster-management/application-ui.svg?token=FQtRyxd2oucrshZSEEqZ&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/open-cluster-management/application-ui)
The UI service for Application Lifecycle

## Design

The UI Platform is developed as an isomorphic react application.  The following major components are used to build this service.

* NodeJS
* Express
* React
* Dust
* Redux
* Webpack 3
* Babel
* Apollo/GraphQL
* Bluemix Carbon
* Jest
* Nightwatch


## Build

<pre>
npm install
   npm run build
or npm run build:watch
or npm run build:production
</pre>

## Running

1. The localhost redirect ui registration URL was removed by the auth team.  You must configure an existing cluster to support local development.

> 1. SSH into your existing cluster (`make ssh`)
> 2. Install `jq` if not already installed (`sudo apt-get install jq -y`)
> 3. Run the `setup-dev.sh` script in `platform-ui`: `curl https://github.com/open-cluster-management/platform-ui/master/setup-dev.sh?token=<token> | sudo bash`
>    or copy the script from `https://github.com/open-cluster-management/platform-ui/blob/master/setup-dev.sh` then execute it
> 4. Copy the environment variables printed at the end of the script and proceed to step 2.

2. Run mcm-ui-api locally following the instructions in the readme.md file from https://github.com/open-cluster-management/mcm-ui-api to get grahql calls working

3. The folloing environment variables need to be set. [shared dev env](https://ibm.ent.box.com/notes/291748731101)
<pre>
export OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=
export OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=
export OAUTH2_REDIRECT_URL=https://localhost:3001/multicloud/applications/auth/callback

#for local testing, from ocp login token
export API_SERVER_URL=
export SERVICEACCT_TOKEN=
export NODE_ENV=development

#serach and mcm-ui-api
export searchApiUrl=`<searchAPIRouteEndpoint>/searchapi/graphql`
export hcmUiApiUrl=`<searchAPIRouteEndpoint>/hcmuiapi`
</pre>

4. Start the server for production
<pre>
npm run start:production
</pre>

5. Start the server for development, make sure execute both following npm commands
<pre>
npm run build:watch
npm run start
</pre>

7. Open a browser to `https://localhost:3001/multicloud/applications`, and you should already be logged in.

## Storybook
<pre>
npm run storybook
</pre>
Launch storybook at: http://localhost:6006/

## Testing

The following will run all unit tests and selenium based tests.  The selenium based tests require the UI running locally or can target a remote cluster.

<pre>
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e
</pre>

## NPM Commands

The full list of npm scripts are described below.

> Note: The build process leverages the Dll and DllReference plugins to extract out vendor plugins for faster build times and improved browser caching.  A separate bundle is created for 3rd-party client-side libraries.  The generated bundle is sourced (_public/dll.vendor.js_) along with its manifest (_vendor-manifest.json_).  If new client dependencies are added or existing versions of dependencies are updated this module needs be regenerated and recommitted back into source control via  `npm run build:dll`.
